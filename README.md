# Getting Started with Structure Design (RCC) Calculator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


# INTRODUCTION

The Structure Design Calculator is a website where the civil engineer or the structural designer can just give input to the application about the design criteria and the material which he/she wishes to use in the structure and about loads the loading conditions. And then the application will tell the user whether the structure will be safe in the material which he wishes to use or he has to change the dimension/configuration of the material. It will also tell us about things like no. of bars which we have to use etc

As if now this project is limited to Reinforcement Cement Concrete (RCC) structures. And mainly focused on the design of beams & slabs
